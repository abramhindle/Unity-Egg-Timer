== Unity Egg Timer ==

Why doesn't Unity have any tea timers or egg timers? Gnome-panel had a great timer applet but with 12.04 I had no luck.

I don't know :(

This was easy enough to write.

Currently it lets you maintain a single timer, you can add 30 seconds, 1 minute or 5 minutes to it
and then it counts down per second unless finally it notifies you that time is up.

This is version 0

Future work:
* Run an application
* Remember favorite times
* Icons
