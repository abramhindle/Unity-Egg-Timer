== Unity Egg Timer ==

Why doesn't Unity have any tea timers or egg timers? Gnome-panel had a great timer applet but with 12.04 I had no luck.

I don't know :(

This was easy enough to write.

Currently it lets you maintain a single timer, you can add 30 seconds, 1 minute or 5 minutes to it
and then it counts down per second unless finally it notifies you that time is up.

This is version 1

=== your ~/.eggtimerrc

The example eggtimerrc is written in json, feel free to define your own custom macros
actions are: "alarm", "run" or "both". "alarm" shows a dialog box, "run" runs the "command" and "both" runs the command shows the dialog box

This ~/.eggtimerrc is what I use:
[
	{
		"name"    : "Boil Water",
		"time"    : 180,
		"action"  : "run",
		"command" : "~/scripts/warn.sh Water\\'s Ready"
	},
	{
		"name"    : "Steep Tea",
		"time"    : 120,
		"action"  : "run",
		"command" : "~/scripts/warn.sh Tea\\'s Ready"
	}
]



Future work:
* Run an application
* Remember favorite times
* Icons
